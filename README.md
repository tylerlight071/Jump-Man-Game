This is the first release of JumpMan, my first game built with Unity. It is a 2D platforming game with 4 levels currently but I will be adding plenty of new things to it in the future!

To get started, simply download the package file, and run the installer. It will create the folder in your chosen directory. Simply go to that directory and run the Jump Man.exe file and you're all set!!

Have fun and keep checking back for new releases!
